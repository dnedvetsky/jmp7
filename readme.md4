This is a simple multithreaded race programm. It creates required numeber of participants and runs a race with them.
First participant is always disqualified - he took magical pony for the ride so judge is not happy.

Classes in programm:
Car - using slightly modified provided class;
CarsInTheRace - technically a wrapper for transforming cars into a threads before launch
Main - self-explanatory
Road - created with some parameters, race is performed there, winner is determined on the race
Judge - helper used to count down and disqualify cars.
